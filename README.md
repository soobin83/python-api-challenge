The main code for WeatherPy is under WeatherPy folder as WeatherPy.ipynb. The exported city_data has been saved under output_data folder as "cities.csv," and the four scatter plot graphs are also saved under output_data folder. The analysis for linear regression is in a markdown below the two graphs, one for northern hemisphere and the second one for southern hemisphere.
The main code for VacationPy is under VacationPy folder as VacationPy.ipynb. 

Also, worked with a tutor and a learning assistant for linear regression definition. I already had the code to create linear regression plots, and the tutor helped me with "def linear_regression(df, x_col_name, y_col_name, hemi_name, coord)" and the learning assistance helped me with putting in the "coord" at the end of the code. The tutor also helped me with cleaning up my code with using "~norther_hemi_filter_s" in code "southern_hemi_df = city_data_df[~norther_hemi_filter_s]".
